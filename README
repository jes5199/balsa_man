Here's a little DSL in clojure for writing DCPU16 assembler.
I could imagine it growing into a macro language.

So far I've implemented only malloc and free. They might be generally useful, it's too early to know.

TODO:
  explicit offsets:
    I should support the ORG instruction

  output my own binaries

  pointer tricks:
    explicit near jumps using SUB PC literal and ADD PC literal
    label math - label plus/minus offset, to address
